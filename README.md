## A game inspired by Webkinz Quizzy's Word Challenge
For Mom :sparkling_heart:

### How to play:

**Objective:** Create a list of 10 words scoring as many points as possible. Each letter is designated with a point value, and points increase toward the center of the board.

**Rules:**
- Once you choose a letter tile in a more central ring of the board, you may not choose a letter in a more outer ring. This means that the middlemost tile can only be used as the last letter of a word.
- Words must be $>=$ 3 letters, and each letter tile may only be used once per word.
- Letter tiles that have been used for the previous word reset for the next word.
- Letter tiles do not need to be adjacent in order to be used. The `shuffle` button will shuffle the letters within each ring.
- Proper nouns are not permitted.
