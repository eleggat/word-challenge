- Assign each letter a unique position
- Select letters (by location), create string, if string matches dictionary word, then add to word lists and replace letters, else raise error
	- Should print total string after each selection
	- Needs submit button

- Shuffle function for changing order of letters within a ring

- Clear function to remove
